## Sammy's Nest Mobile and Web App
This is a personal mobile and web application built by Mike Mao '29 during moments of peace and quiet.
This project was done with some consulting from Drake McAdams '27. While this project is open-source and anyone
may borrow code or inspiration from Sammy's Nest, we would like for credit to be given to Mike Mao and Drake McAdams for
the production and launch of Sammy's Nest.

## Goal of Sammy's Nest
Sammy's Nest aims to be an all-in-one hub for Rice University students to find and engage in campus events related to 
their major, minor, degree, or extra-curricular interests. Currently, campus events are isolated in private mailing lists, 
preventing interested students from being able to engage in these formative activities. Currently, Rice Owl is restricted by
one-per-year club fairs and club gatherings which often conflict with existing class schedules. In addition, many clubs just
aren't present at these campus events, preventing students from being able to engage in these organizations unless they have
existing connections.

Sammy's Nest serves to solve all of these problems through one intuitive, easy-to-use app. By scraping event data from
Rice University department websites and campus clubs, we aim to provide a hub for students to view all campus events occuring on
any given day. Students can then filter events by degree, club, etc. as well as sign up to be notified when an event they're
interested in pops up. 

To make Sammy's Nest more accessible, we've included many language options as well as design tweaks that make the app more
intutiive to use based on a student's language preference, location, time-zone, etc.
